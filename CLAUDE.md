# CLAUDE.md

Conventions for the `mytools` project. This **overwrites** the `CLAUDE.md` in the repo
root during setup — the one there is notes for the upstream template, not for your
project. It is read automatically at the start of every session, so edit it as your
design firms up, either directly or with the `#` prefix from inside a session.

## My fork — fill this in first

**My fork is `venkatk89/ai_agent_workshop`.**

Anything that **creates** — `gh issue create`, `gh pr create` — passes
`--repo venkatk89/ai_agent_workshop`. Never write to
`SACGF/ai_agent_workshop`: that's the shared upstream template and thirty other people
are working from it.

Reading and reviewing someone else's PR is fine when I name their fork explicitly
(`gh pr diff`, `gh pr review --repo <partner>/ai_agent_workshop`). The rule is about
where new things land, not about what you're allowed to look at.

Pass the flag every time. `gh` with a missing or empty `--repo` does not fail — it
silently resolves to the git remote and exits 0, so a forgotten flag looks exactly like
a success.

## What this is

`mytools` is a small reimplementation of a subset of bedtools: `sort`, `merge`,
`intersect`, `subtract`, `closest`. Real `bedtools` is installed and is the oracle —
if our output differs from it on the same input, we are wrong.

## Language

**`mytools` is written in R.** Every subcommand and every test. Don't
introduce a second language without asking me.

One codebase, one language: several agents work on this in parallel and they will each
pick their own otherwise. Reimplementing a single subcommand elsewhere is a deliberate
stretch goal, not a default.

## Interval semantics — read this before touching overlap logic

BED is **0-based, half-open**. `chr1 100 200` covers bases 100..199. Therefore:

- Two intervals overlap iff `a.start < b.end AND b.start < a.end`. Note strict `<`.
- Bookended intervals (`a.end == b.start`) do **not** overlap. They do merge under
  `merge -d 0`.
- Zero-length intervals (`start == end`) are legal in our fixtures and bedtools
  handles them in ways you will not guess. Do not "fix" them — match the oracle.

Every off-by-one bug in this project lives in that comparison. When a golden test
fails, look there first.

## Testing

- `./tests/run_golden.sh` diffs every subcommand against real bedtools on `data/`.
  It does not exist yet — `tests/README.md` has the worked example to build it from.
- **Run it before every commit.** It takes seconds; there is no excuse.
- Fixtures are `data/a.bed`, `data/b.bed` (edge cases) and `data/genes.bed`.
  Do not regenerate or "tidy" them — the edge cases are deliberate.
- New subcommand or flag? Add its golden case in the same commit.
- Unit tests live in `tests/` too and must run without bedtools. One per edge case:
  bookended, zero-length, nested, position 0, and the overlap predicate itself.
- Fixed a failing golden test? Add the unit test that would have caught it first.
- If bedtools does something surprising, the test encodes bedtools' behaviour.
  Add a comment saying why; do not encode what you think it should do.

## Code

- Prefer streaming I/O. Read line by line, write as you go. `sort` is the one
  command allowed to hold a chromosome in memory.
- Input via bedtools-style flags (`-i`, or `-a`/`-b`), required; `-` or `stdin`
  means stdin. `.gz` accepted.
- Errors go to stderr, never stdout — stdout is data and gets piped.
- Exit codes match bedtools: `0` success, `1` for everything else (bad data and
  usage errors alike). bedtools has no separate usage code, so neither do we.
- No third-party runtime dependencies. Standard library only. Test time is exempt:
  unit tests use `testthat`.
- Layout: `./mytools` is the entry point; one file per subcommand under `R/`,
  shared BED parsing and the overlap predicate in `R/bed.R`. `SPEC.md` has the rest.

## Commits and PRs

- Small commits, one logical change each, message referencing the issue: `sort: handle
  unsorted chrom order (#3)`.
- Branch per issue: `feat/3-sort`. Exception: trivial one-liners go straight to main —
  ask me which I want rather than defaulting to a PR.
- Closing an issue means checking the code does what the issue asked, not remembering
  that you wrote it.
- PRs go to **your own fork** — see the fork rule at the top of this file.
